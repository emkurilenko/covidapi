## Task:

Develop and implement an API that allows you to find for a specified list of countries:  The
maximum/minimum number of new cases per day during the selected day/period. Retrieve data through
the API: https://covid19api.com/

Restrictions:

It is necessary to minimize the number of requests to the source website during the daily use of the
application.

Use Java 17+, Spring Boot/Micronaut.

## Solution

Implemented 2 endpoints

1. Get available countries

GET: [/api/country](http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html#/country-controller/availableCountries)

2. Get max and min number of new cases statistic for countries

GET: [/api/statistics/new-cases](http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html#/covid-stats-controller/getMaxAndMinNewCasesStatisticByCountryCodes)

***
if not there are such countries in the database, call API and get data on these countries, then store to DB
***

Implemented 3 jobs 
1. For filling db with countries from API (auto run once after start application)
2. For filling with daily summary new cases

# Start application
In terminal run command:
`docker-compose up -d --build`

After that open in browser
